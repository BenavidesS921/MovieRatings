    How does a nested if differ from an if-else statement?
    What are the advantages of using switch over multiple if statements?
    How does the conditional operator simplify decision-making?
    What is short-circuit evaluation, and how does it affect the use of logical operators?

    A nested if statement allows multiple conditions to be met before an action is taken. as opposed to a         regular if-else statement, where it gives a statement for condtions that are true or false. 
    An advantage to using switch statements is you can use a single variable to to test multiple values. 
    The conditional operator simplifies decision making by providing 3 simple operands. Giving the same           output as any if-else statement.  
    A short circuit evaluation is a feature of the AND and OR operators. This feature lets the evaluation go      as far as necessary. It stops as soon as a true conditon is met.
